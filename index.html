                        <h3>Character Description</h3>
                        <p>A cool and cynical girl in her 2nd year of high school. Her traits include her cool eyes and a 
                            mole under her left eye. She has a cold attitude towards the Producer. </p>

                        <p>Madoka is extremely honest, and doesn't mince words ── when she hates something, she doesn't 
                            hide her hatred, but when she's happy she doesn't hide her happiness. She openly dislikes the 
                            Producer and his enthusiastic, idealistic personality, but despite not having a lot of 
                            motivation towards becoming an idol she works extremely seriously towards that goal and often 
                            practices in secret (though she hates when the Producer finds that out). She may have a rude 
                            and outright mean personality, but she has a soft heart. For example, she can't be entirely 
                            happy when she passes an audition, because her win means that many other girls lost.</p>

                        <p>After her childhood friend Toru was suddenly scouted to work as an idol, Madoka immediately grew 
                            suspicious and went to 283 Production. She lied and said she wanted to be an idol to see if the 
                            office was legitimate. Though she was initially disgusted when the Producer scouted her, she 
                            reluctantly agreed just to make sure Toru was safe. </p>

                <p>Toru Asakura is one of the idols that can be produced in THE IDOLM@STER Shiny Colors. She is voiced by

                        <h3>Character Description</h3>
                        <p>A girl who doesn't put on appearances. Not worrying about how others see her, she is calm and 
                            goes at her own pace. However, she has an aura that attracts everyone in her overflowingly 
                            transparent appearance. She is in her 2nd year of high school. </p>

                        <p>She has a serious and honest personality, but she also is rather easygoing and follows her 
                            whims. Toru isn't necessarily dishonest, but she doesn't like expressing strong feelings or 
                            showing her true self. Therefore, it's hard to tell what she's thinking. </p>

                        <p>She was scouted by the Producer while he waited for a bus. At first, she turned him down 
                            harshly, but suddenly changed her mind. It's later revealed in her story that, although the 
                            Producer doesn't remember, they met at that same bus stop when she was a child and he was a 
                            college student. They killed time at a local park while waiting for the same bus, and the 
                            Producer encouraged Toru to keep climbing the jungle gym when she thought she couldn't. This
                            memory stuck in her mind, and made a deep impression on her. However, because Toru was often 
                            mistaken for a boy when she was younger, the Producer doesn't recognize her at all, though he 
                            does remember that day. </p>

                    <h3>Character Description</h3>
                    <p>A girl who is reminiscent of a small animal: bold at home, meek elsewhere. She is a diligent hard 
                        worker and is good at studying. She gets easily tricked and often gets teased by her childhood 
                        friends. She is in her 1st year of high school. </p>

                    <p>Despite being easily startled and tiny, Koito is a hardworker who sees herself as the mature friend 
                        who holds their group together. Ever since she was small, her strict parents pressured her to be an 
                        honor student, so she didn't get to experience a lot of her childhood (for example, she says in her 
                        S-SSR1 card that she's never been to a Halloween party before). She often tries to act boastful or 
                        bold, but her true, more timid and childish nature always shines through. However, even though she 
                        tries to act responsible, she often feels self-conscious about how much harder she has to work at 
                        becoming an idol than everyone else. </p>

                        <li>Koito's parents are very strict and want her to focus strictly on academic success. She 
                            initially kept becoming an idol a secret from them.</li>
                        <li>She is one of the few people Madoka will act softly towards, and will often give candy as a gift.</li>
                        <li>Her given name, Koito means small thread. Two kanjis in her name; 小 (ko) and 糸 (ito) mean 
                            small and thread respectively.</li>
                        <li>She often says "pya/pyeh/pi" when startled.</li>
